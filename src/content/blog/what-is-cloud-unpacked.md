I've worked on various open source projects over the years.
They tend to be tools such as CLIs, websites, etc.
Many of my projects tend to relate to each other by being in the same or similar fields.
This allows me to naturally group these projects by namespace or "brand" per say.
For example, I have a lot of CI/CD related tooling so I created a GitHub organization called [HubCI](https://github.com/huci) to organize all of those tools.
These leads me to my first love in tech: making websites, hosting, and managing those servers.

I started learning HTML and JavaScript over 20 years ago so that I can make websites.
I learned Linux so that I can use the hosting provider Linode to host client websites and make money monthly.
Working at Linode made my love for the Internet, networking, servers, etc quadruple.
I've even called it the [best job I've had yet](https://www.feliciano.tech/blog/leaving-linode-best-job-ive-yet/).

Cloud Unpacked is the continuation of that love.
A blog to write about the intricacies of developer-focused hosting providers like Linode or DigitalOcean.
A place to share homelab tools with fellow geeks.
And my favorite, a place for Linux server documentation.

I hope you hang around.
